# The Husky Programming Language

Husky is a new programming language designed specifically for developing hybrid AI systems.

## What are hybrid AI systems?

## Why a new programming language?

Existing programming languages fall short because they lack the appropriate abstractions, expressive power, and safety guarantees needed for building hybrid AI systems.

Husky introduces several key features designed to overcome these limitations:
- TODO
- TODO
- TODO

While some of these features may already exist in other programming languages, Husky integrates them in a way that is harmonious and particularly suited for hybrid AI development. A programming language is not just a collection of features—it’s about how those features interact and complement each other.

## Nature of the Project

Husky is currently a personal project. Despite the significant effort required to develop it, I believe it’s worthwhile because it enables me to tackle specific problems that are of great interest to me. However, more evidence is needed to determine if the language will be valuable to a wider audience beyond my immediate circle. It’s also possible that while Husky is useful, a fundamental redesign of certain aspects could lead to the creation of an entirely new project, one that is inspired by Husky but ventures in a different direction that is more suitable for the wider audience.

At this stage, there is no intention to position Husky as the "next-generation AI language" meant to replace Python or C++. I believe programming languages should first find their "killer application"—solving a unique problem that no other language can address—before seeking broader adoption. My primary goal is to avoid hype and misinformation, and I will actively work to ensure accurate representation of the project.

## Timeline

Husky is currently in the prototyping phase, with a focus on AI research. The plan is to evolve it into a stable language as AI technology matures.

At the moment, I am recovering from hand pain, so the priority is delivering Husky for my personal research. Comprehensive tutorials and documentation will not be available for at least two years. While there may be occasional pieces of tutorials and documentation released sporadically, do not expect a fully polished release in the near future.

In short, Husky will remain largely under wraps for the next couple of years, although it will be open source. The full story of the language will unfold slowly over time.
