# The Husky Programming Language

Husky is a new programming language for developing modular AI systems.

## What are modular AI systems?

## Why a new programming language?

Existing languages are not good enough because they lack the proper abstraction, expressive power, and safety guarantees.

Husky is built with the following features:
- TODO
- TODO
- TODO

Many of the above features are already seen in existing languages. However, they are integrated harmonically for hybrid AI development. After all, a programming language is not just about the union of its features but also about their interaction.

## Timeline

Husky is currently in the prototyping stage, focusing on AI research. It will transform into a stable language once AI technology is mature.

I'm currently recuperating from hand pains. The focus is to deliver Husky for my own research first. The tutorials and documentations will wait at least two years.

In other words, for the next two years, there is no intention of publicly introducing the Husky programming language, although it's open source. There's going to sporadic pieces of tutorials and documentations here and there, but don't expect the full story to be revealed very soon.
