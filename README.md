# Husky
The Husky Programming Language

Make programming great again!

Warning: this repo is still under heavy construction. For example, documentation is still serious lacking!

Still, if one's curious about what's going on, please take a look at the other repo xiyuzhai/husky-book, where I'll update on a higher priority.

# Introduction

Husky is a research oriented programming language that aims primarily to extend the boundary of programming itself (rather than replacing certain languages in certain domains). For example, Husky shall make it possible to write a strongly explainable and efficient classifier for image recognition tasks by using a more powerful functional programming paradigm combined with eager ones and faciliated by a builtin debugging system ... (todo: phrase this more properly;)

The primary focus is the language frontend design. In a long time, Husky will rely on Rust/Zig/C/Cpp for compilation so that we don't need to spend too much time in dealing with IRGen.

# About Development

This project was created by and is currently maintained solo by Xiyu Zhai, a Phd in MIT EECS, whose primary background is actually in pure math and has just programmed intensively for the last two years. So please help, smart people!

It was created as a language to implement certain ideas for efficient image classification, which is hard to do in existing languages. Originally it was written in C++, and had gone through many versions that were influenced heavily by C++. However, the lacking of ocaml-like clean pattern and memory safety and many other things matching make development hard. Then, a Rust version was created from scratch and despite of the learning curve, the development is quite smooth and the design of language is becoming very similar to Rust.
