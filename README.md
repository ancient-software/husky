# The Husky Programming Language

Husky is a new programming language for developing hybrid AI systems.

## What are hybrid AI systems?

Roughly speaking, a pure AI system is either a purely rule-based inference engine or an end-to-end neural network (like LLMs). Both have their respective advantages and disadvantages. A hybrid AI system combines these advantages and avoids their disadvantages.

## Why a new programming language?

Existing languages are not good enough because they lack the proper abstraction, expressive power, and safety guarantees.

Husky is built with the following features:
- todo
- todo
- todo

Many of the above features are already seen in existing languages. However, they are integrated harmonically for hybrid AI development. After all, a programming language is not simply the union of its features.
