# Husky
The Husky Programming Language

Make programming great again!

Warning: this repo is still under heavy construction. For example, documentation is still serious lacking!

Still, if one's curious about what's going on, please take a look at the other repo xiyuzhai/husky-book, where I'll update on a higher priority.

# Introduction

Husky is a research oriented programming language that aims primarily to extend the possibilities of programming itself (rather replacing certain languages in certain domains). For example, Husky shall make it possible to write a strongly explainable and efficient classifier for image recognition tasks ... (todo: phrase this more properly;)

The primary focus is the language frontend design. In a long time, Husky will rely on Rust/Zig/C/Cpp for compilation so that we don't need to spend too much time in dealing with IRGen.
