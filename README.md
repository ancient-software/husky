## Why a new programming language?

Existing languages are not good enough because they lack the proper abstraction, expressive power, and safety guarantees.

Husky is built with the following features:
- TODO
- TODO
- TODO

Many of the above features are already seen in existing languages. However, they are integrated harmonically for hybrid AI development. After all, a programming language is not just about the union of its features but also about their interaction.

## Timeline

Husky is currently in the prototyping stage, focusing on AI research. It will transform into a stable language once AI technology is mature.
