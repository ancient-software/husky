# math

In the normal language, text -> token -> ast -> syn expr -> sema expr.

However, here text <--> token <--> ast -> syn expr -> sema expr.

Further text <--> token <--> ast is totally handled automatically.

Basically, the user modify directly the asts.

Math asts is centered around displayability, basically the same as typst ast.
