We begin with the expression $(a+b)^2$, which represents the product of $(a+b)$ and $(a+b)$:\n\n$(a+b)^2 = (a+b)(a+b)$\n\nApplying the distributive property (often called the FOIL method), we multiply each term in the first parenthesis by each term in the second parenthesis:\n\n$= a(a+b) + b(a+b)$\n\nFurther distributing, we get:\n\n$= a^2 + ab + ba + b^2$\n\nSince multiplication is commutative ($ab = ba$), we can simplify this to:\n\n$= a^2 + 2ab + b^2$\n\nThis demonstrates that $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.\n\nNow, let's explore the non-negativity of $(a+b)^2$.  We can approach this in several ways.\n\n**Method 1: Direct from the expanded form**\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, their squares, $a^2$ and $b^2$, are always non-negative ($a^2 \\ge 0$ and $b^2 \\ge 0$).  The term $2ab$ can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the values of $a$ and $b$. However, consider the expression  $a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.  This expression is equivalent to $(a+b)^2$, which represents the square of a real number. The square of any real number is always non-negative. Therefore, $(a+b)^2 \\ge 0$.\n\n**Method 2: Considering the cases of ab**\n\nWe can analyze two cases based on the sign of the product $ab$:\n\n* **Case 1: $ab \\ge 0$**  If $ab$ is non-negative, then $2ab \\ge 0$.  Since $a^2 \\ge 0$ and $b^2 \\ge 0$, the sum $a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ must also be non-negative. Therefore, $(a+b)^2 \\ge 0$.\n\n* **Case 2: $ab < 0$** If $ab$ is negative, then $2ab < 0$.  However, we know that $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.  We can rewrite this as $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$.  While $2ab$ is negative, the sum $a^2 + b^2$ is always non-negative and is always greater than or equal to $|2ab|$.  Therefore, the sum $a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$ will still be greater than or equal to 0, ensuring that $(a+b)^2 \\ge 0$.  This can be proven more formally using the triangle inequality or by completing the square as seen in the provided solution.\n\n**In conclusion:** Regardless of the values of $a$ and $b$, the expression $(a+b)^2$ is always greater than or equal to zero, due to the fundamental property that the square of any real number is non-negative.  Both methods provide a complete and rigorous demonstration of this fact.\n"

First, we rewrite $(a+b)^2$ as the product $(a+b)(a+b)$.  Then, we distribute the $a$ term in the first parenthesis across the terms in the second parenthesis, and similarly distribute the $b$ term. This yields $a(a+b) + b(a+b)$.  Further distribution gives $a^2 + ab + ba + b^2$. Since multiplication is commutative ($ab = ba$), we can simplify this to $a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.\n\nLet $x = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.  This expression represents the expansion of $(a+b)^2$.  We can demonstrate this through completing the square.\n\nStarting with $x = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$, we observe that the first three terms form a perfect square trinomial.  A perfect square trinomial is a trinomial that can be factored into the square of a binomial. In this case, we recognize that $a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ is the expansion of $(a+b)^2$.  Therefore, we can rewrite $x$ as:\n\\begin{align*} x &= a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\\\ &= (a+b)^2\\end{align*} \n\nNow, let's prove that $(a+b)^2 \\ge 0$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.\n\nSince the square of any real number is non-negative, we have $(a+b)^2 \\ge 0$. This is a direct consequence of the definition of squaring a number.  Multiplying a real number by itself always results in a non-negative value.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the terms individually. Since $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, we know that $a^2 \\ge 0$ and $b^2 \\ge 0$.  Therefore, $a^2 + b^2 \\ge 0$.\n\nNow let's analyze the term $2ab$.\n\nCase 1: $ab \\ge 0$. If the product $ab$ is non-negative (both $a$ and $b$ are positive or both are negative), then $2ab \\ge 0$.  Consequently, $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\ge 0$.\n\nCase 2: $ab < 0$. If the product $ab$ is negative (one of $a$ and $b$ is positive and the other is negative), then $2ab < 0$. However, we know that $a^2 + b^2 \\ge 0$.  We can show that $a^2 + b^2 \\ge |2ab|$. This is because $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\ge 0$.  Rearranging this inequality, we get $a^2 + b^2 \\ge -2ab$. Since $a^2 + b^2$ is always non-negative, and $-2ab$ is positive when $ab<0$, the inequality holds.  Therefore, $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\ge 0$.\n\nIn conclusion, regardless of the signs of $a$ and $b$, $(a+b)^2 \\ge 0$. This is true because the expression expands to a sum of non-negative terms ($a^2$, $b^2$) and a term ($2ab$) which is either non-negative or whose magnitude is less than or equal to $a^2+b^2$.\n"

We consider the expression $x = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$. We can rewrite this as $x = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a+b)(a+b) = (a+b)^2$.\nAdding and subtracting $b^2$ to complete the square, we have:\n\\begin{align*} x &= a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\\\ &= (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\\\ &= (a+b)^2\\end{align*} \nSince the square of any real number is non-negative, we have $(a+b)^2 \\ge 0$, because $(a+b)^2 = (a+b)(a+b) = a(a+b) + b(a+b) = a^2 + ab + ab + b^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\ge 0$.  Alternatively, we can consider the following:\nSince $a$ is a real number, $a^2 \\ge 0$. Similarly, since $b$ is a real number, $b^2 \\ge 0$.\nThen $a^2 + b^2 \\ge 0$.

Then $2ab \\ge 0$, so $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\ge 0$.\nConsider the case where $ab < 0$. Then $2ab < 0$. However, $a^2 + b^2 \\ge 0$, and  $a^2 + b^2 \\ge |2ab|$, since $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a+b)^2 = (a+b)(a+b) = a(a+b) + b(a+b) = a^2 + ab + ab + b^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.\nThus, $ a^2 + b^2 \\ge |2ab| \\ge 2ab$.

That is, for any real number $x$, $x^2 \\geq 0$.\n\nConsider the expression $(a+b)^2$.  This can be expanded using the distributive property (or FOIL):\n$$(a+b)^2 = (a+b)(a+b) = a^2 + ab + ba + b^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.$$\n\nWe can rewrite this expression as:\n$$(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.$$\n\nNow, consider the term $a^2$. Since $a$ is a real number, $a^2 \\geq 0$. Similarly, $b^2 \\geq 0$.\n\nLet's analyze the term $2ab$.  We can express this term as $2ab = (a+b)^2 - a^2 - b^2$. Thus, $2ab$ can be both positive and negative.\n\nHowever, we can consider the following:\nLet $x = a+b$. Then $(a+b)^2 = x^2$. Since $x$ is a real number (because $a$ and $b$ are real numbers), $x^2 \\geq 0$. Therefore, $(a+b)^2 \\geq 0$.\n\nAlternatively, we can complete the square:\n\\begin{align*} (a+b)^2 &= a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\\\ &= a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\end{align*} \nSince $a^2 \\ge 0$ and $b^2 \\ge 0$, we have that $(a+b)^2 \\ge 2ab$.\n\nHowever, we know that  $x^2 \\ge 0$ for any real number $x$.

We know that the square of any real number is non-negative. Therefore, $a^2 \\geq 0$ and $b^2 \\geq 0$.  Also, $2ab$ is a real number.  Expanding $(a+b)^2$, we have $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.  Since $a^2 \\geq 0$ and $b^2 \\geq 0$, we have $a^2 + b^2 \\geq 0$.  Then, $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a^2 + b^2) + 2ab$. While $a^2 + b^2 \\ge 0$, we have that $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a+b)^2$. Since $(a+b)$ is a real number, its square is non-negative. Therefore, $(a+b)^2 \\geq 0$.\n\\end{proof}\n```\n\n----- SIDE INSTRUCTIONS -----\n\nThere should only be one solution.
