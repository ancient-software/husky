Write one only only one sentence of this format after stating all variables and assumptions.\n            \n\n----- INPUT -----\n```latex\n\\begin{proof}\nWe have $(a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 + b^2 - 2bc + c^2 + c^2 - 2ca + a^2 = 2(a^2+b^2+c^2 - ab - bc - ca)$.\nWe have $(a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2 \\ge 0$.\nWe have $2(a^2+b^2+c^2 - ab - bc - ca) \\ge 0$.\nWe have $a^2+b^2+c^2 \\ge ab+bc+ca$.\n\\end{proof}\n```\n\n----- SIDE INSTRUCTIONS -----\nSometimes you need to combine the two. For example, use `Let $x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}$. Assume $x\\\\ge 0$` to express `Let $x$ be a positive real number.`.\n                Wrap the proof in \\begin{{proof}} and \\end{{proof}}. \n\n\nHere are some examples that help you understand the task.\n\n------- EXAMPLES -------\nExample 1:\n\n---- EXAMPLE ----\n\nInput:\n\n```latex\nProve that $1+1=2$.\n\\begin{proof}\nIt's trivial that $1+1=2$.\n\\end{proof}\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```latex\nProve that $1+1=2$.\n\\begin{proof}\nThe goal is to prove $1+1=2$.\nIt's trivial that $1+1=2$.\n\\end{proof}\n```\n            \n---------\n\n\nHere are some antiexamples that show you what you should definitely avoid at all costs.\n\n------- ANTI-EXAMPLES -------\nAntiexample 1:\n\nThe following antiexample is bad because it introduces unnecessary variables.\n\n---- ANTI-EXAMPLE INPUT ----\n```latex\nProve that $1+1=2$.\n\\begin{proof}\nIt's trivial that $1+1=2$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n---- ANTI-EXAMPLE OUTPUT ----\n```latex\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}$.\nLet $y\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}$.\nThe goal is to prove $1+1=2$.\nIt's trivial that $1+1=2$.\n\\end{proof}\n```\n\nThis is really stupid because $x$ and $y$ are not stated in the problem description. Furthermore, it states the wrong goal for the problem.\n            \n---------\n"
