Don't include any other text in any case.\n\n----- MAIN INSTRUCTIONS -----\nFor any superscript and subscript, if the intended base is not atomic latex expression, wrap it in curly braces. For example, $(a+b)^2$ should be replaced by ${{(a+b)}}^2$. For example, $\\left(a+b\\right)^2$ should be replaced by ${\\left(a+b\\right)}^2$. Be extremely strict about this. Don't change anything else in the strictest sense.\n\n----- INPUT -----\n```latex\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\nAssume $x > 0$.\nThe goal is to prove $x + \\frac{1}{x} \\ge 2$.\nWe have $x>0$.\nWe have ${(x-1)}^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 \\ge 0$.\nWe have $x^2 + 1 \\ge 2x$ because ${(x-1)}^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 \\ge 0$.\nWe have $x + \\frac{1}{x} \\ge 2$ because $x^2 + 1 \\ge 2x$ and $x>0$.\n\\end{proof}\n```\n\n\n----- SIDE INSTRUCTIONS -----\n\n                    Ensure the result is valid latex code, i.e., formula is wrapped in $...$.\n                    \n                    Wrap the proof in \\begin{{proof}} and \\end{{proof}}.\n\n\nHere are some examples that help you understand the task.\n\n------- EXAMPLES -------\nExample 1:\n\n---- EXAMPLE\n```latex\n$(a+b)^2 \\ge 0$ should be replaced by ${{(a+b)}}^2 \\ge 0$.\n```\n\n---------\nExample 2:\n\n---- EXAMPLE\n```latex\n$\\left(a+b\\right)^2 \\ge 0$ should be replaced by ${\\left(a+b\\right)}^2 \\ge 0$.\n```\n\n---------\nExample 3:\n\n---- EXAMPLE\n```latex\n$f(a+b)^2 \\ge 0$ should be replaced by ${f(a+b)}^2 \\ge 0$.\n```\n\n---------\n"
